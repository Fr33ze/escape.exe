Application doesn't work in Emulator yet but was tested on multiple Android devices.
Please use an Android device for testing at this point. 

Also, we have some technical issues with the javadoc html. The program creates an empty ZIP file for some reason. 
Comments are all done though.
We will try to push it as soon as possible but due to covid restrictions we don't have access to a different PC yet.
